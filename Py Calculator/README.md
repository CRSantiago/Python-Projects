# Py Calculator

The calculator accepts two numbers and can perform basic arithmetic functions such as addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. 

# Updates

## Version 2
I created an updated version that is OOP based. It has a Calculator class that performs all the functions and a main application that executes the functions accordingly.

## GUI
A similar program was built but with a proper GUI. I used Tkinter for the interface.
