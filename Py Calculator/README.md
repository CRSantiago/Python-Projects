# Py Calculator

The calculator accepts two numbers and can perform basic arithmetic functions such as addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. 

# Future Plans

As my skills develop, I want to improve on its functionality such as expanding numbers that can be passed in, more advance arithmetic functions just to name a few.
